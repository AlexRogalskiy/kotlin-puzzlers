Kotlin Puzzlers
===============

Kotlin is a pragmatic programming languages that was designed to avoid many well-known Java Puzzlers. 

This is a collection that I have found so far.

What is a puzzler?
==================
 
A puzzler is some code that doesn't work the way it seems it should work.

An ideal programming language won't have any.

The puzzlers here are presented as *kts* files (Kotlin Scripts), which can skip the
`main()` function and are compiled on-the-fly when run, thus allowing some of them to have 
"will not compile" option.

Eventually, this will become a conference talk or even several ones.

As is common with puzzlers, please submit yours (either pull requests or issues) and I will credit you during the talk.

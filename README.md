= Kotlin Puzzlers

I have started collecting Kotlin puzzlers here.

== What is a puzzler?
 
A puzzlers is some code that doesn't work the way it seems it should work.

An ideal programming language won't have any.

== Contributing

Eventually, this will become a conference talk.

As is common with puzzlers, please submit yours (either pull requests or issues) and I will credit you during the talk.

Correct answer: **c) An exception - java.lang.ClassCastException: kotlin.Unit cannot be cast to java.lang.Void**

* Nothing is represented as java.lang.Void in JVM
* suspendCoroutineUninterceptedOrReturn() returns anything it is asked for (at compile time)
* kotlin.Unit is generated by the compiler because it cannot have an instance of koltin.Nothing/java.lang.Void
